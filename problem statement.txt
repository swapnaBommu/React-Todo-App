Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features)
●	Fetch and show todo items from the api - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
●	Add a todo item, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and save the item in react state. 
(This will be a dummy request, you won’t be able to add items to the server. But the request is valid and will send you some data. Read the guide).
●	Update the item, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
●	Delete an item, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).
